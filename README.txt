Wikipedia Viewer
<br>
This was a project part of freeCodeCamp. Search a term and the first 10 results will list on the screen with a brief description of the term. You can click on the terms and it will redirect you to the respective Wikipedia page. There is also a random button that will direct you to a random Wikipedia page.
I used HTML/CSS/BootStrap 4/Animate.css/FontAwesome.css/JavaScript/jQuery
